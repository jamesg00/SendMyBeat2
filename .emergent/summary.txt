<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully developed SendMyBeat.com, a full-stack application. Initial development focused on AI tag generation (using OpenAI GPT-4o), description management, and JWT authentication with a modern React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. Key features were added iteratively: YouTube video upload with Google OAuth, token refresh, and FFmpeg for video creation. A subscription paywall using Stripe was integrated, including credit tracking and frontend components for upgrades. The UI was completely redesigned with a modern aesthetic, dark mode, and user-provided branding. Throughout the process, the engineer addressed bugs related to Google OAuth (403 errors), datetime handling, ffmpeg paths, and YouTube tag formatting, demonstrating strong debugging and problem-solving skills, while also creating comprehensive setup and guide documentation.

<product_requirements>
SendMyBeat.com is designed to help music producers maximize beat discoverability. Key features include:
1.  **AI Tag Generation**: Generate up to 500 advanced, search-optimized tags (like vidIQ) based on user search queries.
2.  **Description Management**: Save and manage multiple custom or AI-refined descriptions as templates, with copy-paste functionality. AI can also generate descriptions based on user inputs (email, socials, BPM, price). The AI refine text area should be resizable, and refined text savable.
3.  **YouTube Integration**: Upload image and audio (MP3/WAV) files to YouTube. This requires Google OAuth for full YouTube access, with options for public, unlisted, or private visibility. Uploaded files should originate from local storage, and generated descriptions/tags are automatically applied.
4.  **Monetization**: Implement a subscription paywall via Stripe. Users get 2 free daily AI tag generations or description refinements, and 2 free YouTube uploads. Subscribers receive unlimited AI usage and YouTube uploads. An Upgrade to Pro button should be visible to free users.
5.  **UI/UX**: Modern and clean design tailored for music producers, including a user-provided logo, dark/light mode toggle, collapsible description lists, and a progress bar for tag generation.
6.  **Information Pages**: Include Terms and Conditions, About pages, and a footer with social media links (Instagram, YouTube, SoundCloud).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the FastAPI application. It handles user authentication (login, registration), AI tag generation, description management (save, retrieve, refine), YouTube OAuth flow (authorization, token refresh, video upload), and Stripe subscription processing (checkout sessions, webhooks, credit management). It integrates with MongoDB, OpenAI, Google APIs, and Stripe. Extensive modifications throughout the project.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains environment variables crucial for backend operation, including MongoDB connection string, database name, CORS origins, Emergent LLM key, JWT and session secret keys, Google API credentials, and Stripe API keys. This file is vital for service connectivity and security.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React application entry point. It sets up client-side routing, manages global authentication state, and integrates the  component. Routes for , , , and  are defined here, with planned routes for Terms and About pages.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Defines global CSS styles, including the custom modern design system and theme variables for dark/light modes. Significantly updated to reflect the user's requested aesthetic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.js**: Handles user login and registration, interacting with backend authentication endpoints. Fixed for a duplicate component definition.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js**: The central user interface. It contains UI for AI tag generation, managing saved descriptions (now collapsible), YouTube upload functionality, and displays user credits. It integrates  and . This file has undergone multiple edits for new features and UI/UX improvements (dark mode, progress bar, subscription logic, upload limits).
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/DarkModeToggle.js**: A reusable React component that allows users to switch between light and dark themes, applying global CSS variables.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/SubscriptionBanner.js**: Displays the user's current subscription status and an Upgrade to Pro button, making the upgrade option always visible.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/UpgradeModal.js**: A modal component detailing subscription benefits and facilitating Stripe checkout.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.js**: A newly created static page providing the application's privacy policy, a requirement for Google OAuth verification.
-   **/app/scripts/generate_secrets.py**: A utility script created to help users generate secure JWT and session secret keys for their  file.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the free YouTube upload limits for non-subscribing users.
-   Finalize the content and integration of the Terms and Conditions page.
-   Finalize the content and integration of the About page.
-   Implement the global footer with the user's specified social media links (Instagram, YouTube, SoundCloud).

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the user's request to introduce a free usage tier for YouTube uploads, similar to the existing AI generation limits (2 free uploads for non-subscribers, unlimited for subscribers). This involved updating the backend logic in  to manage these new limits. Concurrently, modifications were made to the frontend in  to integrate these upload limits into the user interface and prepare for the addition of new static pages (Terms and Conditions and About) and a footer with social links. The last recorded action indicates the engineer was in the process of updating the subscription status endpoint, likely to reflect and enforce these newly introduced YouTube upload limits.

<optional_next_step>
Finalize YouTube upload limits, create 'Terms and Conditions' and 'About' pages, and integrate the footer with social media links.
