The trajectory details an intensive development and debugging process for the SendMyBeat.com application. The work began with addressing user-reported bugs, specifically a non-functional Analyze Beat feature and failing YouTube uploads. The upload issue was traced to a missing FFmpeg dependency, which was subsequently installed. The Analyze Beat bug was a frontend issue where the component was incorrectly rendered only when a YouTube account was connected; this was fixed by moving the component's code block.

A major portion of the work involved a complete, iterative redesign of the UI/UX based on user feedback. The user requested a Matrix/arcade theme, providing a specific font. This led to multiple cycles of implementing a black/green theme, adjusting font usage, applying the theme globally across all pages (including static ones like Privacy Policy), and fixing light/dark mode toggling.

Simultaneously, significant feature enhancements were made to the core AI tag generation. This included:
1.  Adding a YouTube search algorithm to find popular songs by an artist and create type beat tags.
2.  Allowing users to add their own custom tags during generation.
3.  Enabling users to add more tags to an already-generated set.
4.  Dramatically improving the AI prompt to generate hyper-specific, SEO-friendly tags instead of generic ones.
5.  Fixing the FFmpeg video creation process to preserve the original image aspect ratio (using padding) and prevent audio quality degradation by removing compression.

The most recent task, requested just before this summary, is to make the entire website responsive and mobile-friendly to fix scaling and layout issues on smaller screens. The previous engineer had just begun adding responsive utility classes to the CSS files.

<product_requirements>
SendMyBeat.com is a web application for music producers designed to enhance beat discoverability on YouTube.

Core features include:
-   **AI Tag & Description Generation:** Users can generate YouTube tags and descriptions based on a title and artist influences. The AI has been enhanced to search YouTube for an artist's popular tracks to create highly specific, SEO-optimized type beat tags.
-   **Custom Tag Management:** Users can input their own tags during generation and add more tags to an existing generated set, up to a 500-character limit.
-   **YouTube Upload:** Users upload an audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV) and an image. The backend uses FFmpeg to create a high-quality video (preserving audio and image aspect ratio) and uploads it to their connected YouTube channel with the generated metadata.
-   **Beat Analyzer:** An AI tool that analyzes a beat's title and tags to predict its YouTube performance potential, providing strengths and weaknesses.
-   **UI/UX:** The application now features a comprehensive Matrix/Arcade theme, with a black-and-green dark mode and a white-and-green light mode. This theme, including a custom Karmatic Arcade font for branding, is applied globally across the landing page, dashboard, and all informational pages. The entire site is expected to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

<pending_tasks>
- The primary and only pending task is to make the entire website fully responsive and mobile-friendly. The user reported that the UI looks squished on narrow screens.
</pending_tasks>
<current_work>
The last task initiated by the previous engineer was to address the user's request to make the entire website responsive and mobile-friendly. The user complained that the site looks squished up if i mae the window more narrow.

To begin this task, the engineer took the following steps:
1.  **Identified the Need:** Acknowledged the user's request to fix scaling issues across the application for better viewing on all screen sizes, including mobile phones.
2.  **Initial CSS Implementation:** Started by adding global responsive utility classes to the application's CSS files. Specifically, edits were made to:
    -   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Added comprehensive responsive utilities to handle different screen sizes.
    -   **/app/frontend/src/matrix-theme.css**: Added responsive utilities to ensure the theme-specific elements (like the grid background) scale properly.
3.  **Service Restart:** A final action was to restart the frontend service to apply these initial CSS changes.

The work was paused at this point. The next logical step would be to apply these new utility classes and other responsive design principles (like Flexbox/Grid adjustments and media queries) to individual components, starting with  and , to fix the specific layout issues.

<optional_next_step>
Continue the work on making the website responsive by applying the newly added CSS utilities and further refining the styling of components, starting with the , to ensure they scale correctly on all screen sizes.
